# Setting up (Git) aliases on MAC

## .bash_profile

In case you're not aware, there's a hidden file in your Macâ€™s user directory named as **.bash_profile**. This file mostly allows you to configure your command line interface the way you need it. Basically, you can change the terminal prompt, colors of text, **add aliases to functions you use all the time**, and so much more.

You should know right now that this file has a '.' at the beginning of its name which makes it invisible. So you won't be able to find it in your Mac's Finder. To view invisible files in the Terminal you can use the following command:
```
ls -al
```
